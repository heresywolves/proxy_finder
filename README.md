# proxy_finder
_______________________________________________
Get a working proxy list in a matter of seconds
_______________________________________________
Script scrapes free proxies from https://free-proxy-list.net/
Then checks the proxies for connection and filters out dead ones

_______________________________________________
How to:
- Enter type of proxy - HTTP or SOCKS4
- Enter how many working proxies you need
- Answer if you want the list of proxies scraped shuffled or not (if Yes - finding connection will take longer)
- Wait for results

Note:
- Not all working proxies can be used for proxychaining
- Finding and testing HTTP is faster than SOCKS4
